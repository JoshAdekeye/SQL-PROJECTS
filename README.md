# SQL Exercises
Schemas, Questions & Solutions for practicing SQL

## Introduction
This repository contains database schemas, exercise questions, and solutions for SQL practice.

The materials come from two sources:

Wikibooks – SQL Exercises: The schemas and questions are based on the Wikibooks SQL Exercises page (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/SQL_Exercises). 
Solutions are taken from both the Wikibook and my own work (Exercises 1–8). I’ve also added a few extra questions.

My own exercises: Exercises 9–10 are created by me and are based on practical examples I’ve encountered.
